This project contains an assignment task description, respective code written, and relevant dataset for a final project of a computer programming course in January 2022. The code analyses historical match data from all Women's Tennis Association (WTA)'s single tournaments from 2007 to 2021 utilising only fundamental Python data types in order to obtain insights on rankings and to generate an alternative ranking algorithm on players based on matches won or lost within specified time periods. 

This project obtained an overall distinction grade on the course.
